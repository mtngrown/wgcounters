# Utility counters for conflict simulations

Conflicts simulation, often known as "wargames" typically use small, rectangular pieces of cardboard commonly referred to as "counters." Among the wide variety of counter types, counters used for status or configuration sometimes seem incomplete, or there are too few of them shipping with a game. For example, one game models an 11th Cav action in Vietnam requiring area control for victory determination between the 11th Cav and the PAVN 252 opponent in that battle. Since there are no markers for tracking who has control of an area, this project will provide a small sheet of counters each of which displays the insignia of the 11th Cav, known as _The Blackhorse_.

Other markers will designate other units, factions, supply status, fatigue, morale and many other statuses, states, and configurations.

## Designing a counter sheet

The first step in designing a counter sheet is designing a counter. Each counter on the sheet is first rendered as its own file. Once the counter is deemed correct, then the countersheet is constructed by tiling the counters.
